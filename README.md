# LoreLinker

A desktop application for connecting THE LOOOOOOOREEEEEE.

## Vision

LoreLinker is a tool for anyone who likes to create Stories and Characters (and wants to keep track of them). 

Whether you are an artist who needs a place to store information about their lovely characters, an author who is writing the next bestseller and needs to connect the dots or a DnD Dungeon Master planning the next epic adventure of your party... Anything is possible.

Having everything in one place should help the task of creating stories.

## Motivation

Of course I know there are already programs like that out there. But I am here to take my development skills to the next step.

This project started late 2021 when I began my studies in computer science. We had to create a Java Program and I created a little CRUD tool for gathering information about characters in a text-file. For the record: this was my first solo programming project. 

Back then I already realized that I wanted to give that project a second try.

During my 3 years of studying computer science and gaining knowledge and working on other projects I planned on how to improve that character assistant. And now I want to put all my knowledge and skills that I developed to the test.

## Technology

This program should be able to run locally on any major operating system (Windows, Linux and Mac) so it will be implemented using Electron an (probably) React.

The data will be stored in an SQL-Lite.

## Setting up the project

TBD :D

## More information

More information about LoreLinker, it's develoment and it's later usage can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jas20202/LoreLinker/wiki)

But hey! That's just a theory, a- wait wrong movie.
